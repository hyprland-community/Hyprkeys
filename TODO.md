# TODO

- [x] Format keybinds better, maybe with a proper table
  - [x] Remove the `+` in the keybinds that don't have modifiers
  - [x] Add an extra column to mouse keybinds to match table titles
- [x] Optionally (--variables) parse variables and replace them with their actual value
- [x] Account for bind flags, that may be passed in any random order
  - [x] Figure out a regex to match the flags
    - [x] Figure out why the regex doesn't work
- [x] Account for line comments in rows
- [x] Break code into multiple files
  - [x] move command line parsing to a separate file
- [ ] Command line options
  - [ ] Sort output by dispatcher
  - [x] Account for multiple arguments being passed at once
- [ ] Somehow account for keybinds can be set dynamically? (I don't know how to do this)
  - [ ] Add instructions for a pipe to `hyprkeys` to get the keybinds from (user must put binds into a pipe file like xob or wob)
- [ ] Convert i3/sway keybinds to Hyprland keybinds with `--convert`
  - [ ] Possibly more wayland compositors, sway is enough for now.
- [x] Get more than just keybinds, try and get all config options seperated by section
  - [x] Config sections
  - [x] Autostarted applications
  - [x] Keywords from inside `hyprland.conf`
- [ ] **Packaging for various Linux distros**
  - [ ] Nix (WIP)
    - [x] Flake
    - [ ] Legacy nixpkgs package
  - [x] Arch [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hyprkeys)
  - [ ] Fedora (looking for maintainers)
